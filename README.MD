## Why?

As a product designer, user experience is really what matters most. Often engineers over-see things like reachability, font sizes in smaller screen sizes, and white space in larger screens. This plugin allows you to programatically set the web view in Cordova to a specific device size and anchor it to the left or right of your test device.
